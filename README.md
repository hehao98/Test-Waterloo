# Identify the Most Actively Maintained Modules within the OpenStack Neutron Project

## Initializing Environment

The following commands initalize a working Conda environment which can be used to execute the script:

```shell
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate Test-Waterloo
```

After the Conda environment is intialized, run Jupyter Lab to execute the scripts:

```shell
jupyter lab
```

The script is only tested on Ubuntu 22.04 but should work in any Unix-alike OS.
